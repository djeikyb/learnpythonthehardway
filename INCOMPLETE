exercise 16, #3
    totally unsure how to reduce the repitition of write() since
    we're trying to write multiple strings and write() only lets
    us pass one string at a time.

    ANSWER: concatenation operator, +. From ex05

    i can shorten the program to the import of argv plus a line
    that reads and writes. lpthw says single line is possible.

    this also removes the explicit closes. while i don't feel
    that is bad, that feeling rests on my likely wrong under-
    standing of of ex17#6.

exercise 17, #6
    why is close() necessary? strace shows closes in the proper
    places. furthermore, it looks like code like this:

        input = open("foo.txt")
        input.close()

    is redundant. judging by strace, it's algebraic, equivalent
    to:

        input = open("foo.txt")
        open("foo.txt").close()

    so now we have two opens and closes where before we only
    had one.

    what is meant by "formula"?
